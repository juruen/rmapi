// Package rm provides primitives for encoding and decoding
// the .rm format which is a proprietary format created by
// Remarkable to store the data of a drawing made with the device.
//
// Axel Huebl has made a great job of understanding this binary format and
// has written an excellent blog post that helped a lot for writting this package.
// https://plasma.ninja/blog/devices/remarkable/binary/format/2017/12/26/reMarkable-lines-file-format.html
// As well, he has its own implementation of this decoder in C++ at this repository.
// https://github.com/ax3l/lines-are-beautiful
//
// To mention that the format has since evolve to a new version labeled as v3 in the
// header. This implementation is targeting this new version.
//
// As Ben Johnson says, "In the Go standard library, we use the term encoding
// and marshaling for two separate but related ideas. An encoder in Go is an object
// that applies structure to a stream of bytes while marshaling refers
// to applying structure to bounded, in-memory bytes."
// https://medium.com/go-walkthrough/go-walkthrough-encoding-package-bc5e912232d
//
// We will follow this convention and refer to marshaling for this encoder/decoder
// because we want to transform a .rm binary into a bounded in-memory representation
// of a .rm file.
//
// To try to be as idiomatic as possible, this package implements the two following interfaces
// of the default encoding package (https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/).
//  - BinaryMarshaler
//  - BinaryUnmarshaler
//
// The scope of this package is defined as just the encoding/decoding of the .rm format.
// It will only deal with bytes and not files (one must take care of unzipping the archive
// taken from the device, extracting and providing the content of .rm file as bytes).
//
// This package won't be used for retrieving metadata or attached PDF, ePub files.
